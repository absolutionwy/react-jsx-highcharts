## Introduction

A project for integrating [Highcharts Gantt](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts) into a React app, with proper React components for each Highcharts Gantt component. Inspired by [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts), but for Highcharts Gantt, obviously.

## Installation

`npm install --save react-jsx-highcharts-gantt`

You'll need the peer dependencies too

`npm install --save react react-dom prop-types highcharts@^6.0.0 `

## Getting started

The intention of this library is to provide a very thin abstraction of Highcharts Gantt using React components. This has been achieved by passing configuration options as component props.

In the vast majority of cases, the name of the configuration option, and the name of the component prop are the same.

#### Example

TODO


#### Exception 1

TODO


## Example

```jsx
// TODO
```
